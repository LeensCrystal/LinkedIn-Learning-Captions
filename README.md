# LinkedIn-Learning-Captions

After some time using LinkedIn Learning, I realised I couldn't change the size of captions. 

It was important for me, because I prefer watching educational courses on TV sitting on the sofa as I do with Netflix.

Thus, I decided to create this simple project (chrome extension) to handle captions as I wish.

Features:

• Increase/Decrease font size

• Save/Restore prefered font size
